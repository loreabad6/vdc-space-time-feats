# Software documentation for: Vector data cubes for features evolving in space and time
Submitted as a short paper to AGILE 2024.

The directory [`/code`](/code) contains a Quarto file [manuscript-figures.qmd](code/manuscript-figures.qmd) to recreate the figures from the manuscript.
This file has been rendered to a Markdown output ([manuscript-figures.md](code/manuscript-figures.md)) to easily explore the rendered code. 

The directory [`/notebook`](/notebook) contains a computational notebook written with Quarto [vdc-showcase.qmd](notebook/vdc-showcase.qmd) that documents the creation of vector data cubes (VDC) for features that evolve in space and time, namely, lava flows and landslides, as presented in the manuscript. The notebook contains further examples of the usage of VDCs, beyond the ones included in the manuscript. See [vdc-showcase.md](notebook/vdc-showcase.md) for a rendered version.

At the end of both files, the output of `sessionInfo()` is included to document set-up information such as software and packages used.
